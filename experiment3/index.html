                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>This project is composed of two different world generators with autotiling logics, one generating dungeons with rooms and corridors and another generating the overworld with different biomes created with noise().</p>
                </div>
            </div>

                    <h2>Technical</h2>
                    <p>The code generates worlds based on the text editor located next to it, with each symbol representing different tiles and terrains. The user can edit the text editor to make their own world, as well as using the reseed button to randomly generate the worlds.</p>
                    <p>The dungeon generator uses "_", "-", and ".", where "_" and "-" represents the two different types of lava in the background, and "." represents the floor of the dungeon.</p>
                    <p>The overworld generator uses "_", "-" and "W", with "_" and "-" representing the two different types of land terrain, highlands and lowlands and "W" being the water.</p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>This project was done by myself, and I feel that this project was very successful, with the requirements being fulfilled.</p>
                    <p>Requirements</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prompt: I have two projects, one showing a overworld map with rounded biomes and the other showing a dungeon map with rectangular rooms.</li>
                        <li>Grids: Different random seeds do lead to different grids of codes with visible changes.</li>
                        <li>Autotiling: There are more than two distinct codes used in the grid, and appropriate transitions between the codes are rendered successfully.</li>
                        <li>Editing: The audience is able to edit the text version of the grid to change the scene.</li>
                        <li>Incidentals: The codes are rendered with some additional variation, with each tile having slight variations.</li>
                        <li>Life: The world shows signs of life with animations based on time.</li>
                        <li>Statement: This profile homepage offers a Description, Code, and Life. </li>
